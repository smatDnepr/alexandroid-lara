# Laravel Sluggable

A trait to use on your models to generate slugs based on another attribute's value. Supports translated attributes (using [spatie/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable)).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require whitecube/laravel-sluggable
```

## Usage

``` php
namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\HasSlug;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;

    public $sluggable = 'title';
}
```

### Changing the slug storage attribute

By default, the slug is configured to be stored in an attribute named `slug`. You can overwrite this setting with the `public $slugStorageAttribute` property on your model.

```php
namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\HasSlug;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;
  
    public $sluggable = 'title';

    public $slugStorageAttribute = 'custom-slug-column';
}
```

### Conditional sluggable attributes

If needed, you can overwrite the trait's `getSluggable()` method and put your own sluggable attribute choice logic in it:

```php
namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\HasSlug;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;
  
    /**
     * Get the attribute name used to generate the slug from
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function getSluggable()
    {
        return $this->title ? 'title' : 'author';
    }
}
```

### Translated slugs

You can generate slugs based on translated attributes (using [spatie/laravel-translatable](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-translatable)). Remember to add the `slug` attribute to the `public $translatable` array to easily access them.

```php
namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\HasSlug;
use Spatie\Translatable\HasTranslations;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;
    use HasTranslations;
  
    public $translatable = ['title', 'slug'];
    
    public $sluggable = 'title';
}
```

```php
Post::create([
    'title' => [
        'en' => 'The title',
        'fr' => 'Le titre'
    ]
]);

$post->getAttributes()['slug']; // ['en' => 'the-title', 'fr' => 'le-titre']
$post->slug; // the-title (given that the crrent app locale is 'en')
$post->translate('slug', 'fr'); // 'le-titre'
```

## Route Model Binding

Be advised that this package overrides the `getRouteKeyName` method, which means [Laravel's Route Model Binding](https://laravel.com/docs/master/routing#route-model-binding) will use the slug attribute by default (or the `$slugStorageAttribute` you have defined). In most cases, this is great, saves you a step and cleans up your models, but if you must, you can change it to whatever you like.

When using Route Model Binding, some other interesting features become available.

### Custom Route Model Binding Query

Sometimes you'd want to add custom behavior to the query Laravel performs. This packages makes it possible to hook into the query by defining a `getRouteBindingQuery` method on the model, which could be useful in several cases such as including soft-deleted results :

```php
namespace App;

use Whitecube\Sluggable\HasSlug;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasSlug;
    
    // ...

    protected function getRouteBindingQuery($query) {
        return $query->withTrashed();
    }
}
```

### Cross-language redirects

If the slug provided in the URL does not correspond to the current locale's slug translation, but corresponds to a slug in another language, this package can automatically redirect to the proper slug.

An example: given the above example's post, we could imagine the following routing configuration:

```
/en/posts/the-title
/fr/articles/le-titre
```

But if we visit `/fr/articles/the-title`, the package will automatically perform a `301` redirect to `/fr/articles/le-titre`.

This behavior can be disabled by setting `public $slugTranslationRedirect = false;` on your model, in which case visiting `/fr/articles/the-title` will just render a `404` page.

### Translated URL generator

Do you need to generate alternate locale links for a translated sluggable model? We've got you covered. Take a look at `getSluggedUrlForRoute($route, $locale, $fullUrl)`:

```php
$post = Post::create([
    'title' => [
        'en' => 'The title in English',
        'fr' => 'Le titre en Fran√ßais'
    ]
]);

$alternates = [];

foreach (['en', 'fr'] as $locale) {
    $alternates[] = $post->getSluggedUrlForRoute(Route::current(), $locale);
}
```

Considering the current route being `/blog/{post}/{tab}` with request parameter `{tab} = 'comments'`, the result would be:
```
/blog/the-title-in-english/comments
/blog/le-titre-en-francais/comments
```
